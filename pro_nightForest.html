        <h1 class="title-1">Night Forest</h1>
        <p class="body-col-1">
          Night Forest is an interactive immersion environment, whose goal is
          building a forest environment with fluorescent effect. I was inspired
          by the TeamLab projects, which have dreamlike environments. This
          project is also one part of my research project which is about the
          human relations. About the topic of interactive immersion environment,
          researchers always talk about the relations between human and visual,
          human and auditory, and human and space. I, however, want to explore
          the role of technology and how to adjust the relationships between
          humans and humans. David Rokeby explained，"Rather than creating
          finished works, the interactive artist creates relationships". There
          are a lot of relationships in a common space. Technology as a
          mediator, it builds the connections among human. In my project, I also
          want to talk about the relations between human and nature, which is
          human always influence nature environment, but they are also
          influenced by nature environment. Furthermore, people are also one
          part of the environment. In daily life, people are hard to realize
          they are affecting nature environment. What I want to highlight is the
          unconscious state of people, a kind of passive state. The passive
          state also exists among audiences. To be specific, the connections
          were built by digital tools. In contrast with Future Park, by TeamLab,
          this state is more prominent.

        <p class="body-col-1">
          This project is mainly composed of two parts. One is the trees which
          are influenced by people. Another one is the particle systems which
          are drew based on the human boundary. What's more, I use Kinect to
          adjust the range of detection area and use ofxCv to calculate the
          total number of audiences and detect the human boundaries.

          When the total number of people increase, new class of tree will be
          generated and pushed back in the vector, and then the new tree will
          grow. I also map the total number of trees to the total number of
          people to set the limitation, which can make sure computer does not
          crash because of the huge number of branches. As for the color
          system, I choose ADD mode which can make the effect of fluorescent.
        </p>
        <p class="body-col-1">
          When the Kinect find the founder path, the for loop function will
          loop all the points which compose of polylines, and then I use
          calculation(g+=50) to skip some points to make sure that the total
          number of particles will not be too much.
